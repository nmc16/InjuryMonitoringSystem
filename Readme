This is the explanation on how to properly run the Injury Monitoring System (IMS). 

The IMS has been designed to help the medical staff of a sporting team determine if 
a player has received an impact to the head great enough to cause a concussion. 

The System consist of four components, a sensor for taking in acceleration data, 
a data base of the player acceleration information,  an Emergency System representing 
medical staff and an app for use by the teams trainer.  

When the sensor and database detect a possible emergency an alarm is triggered on the trainer’s 
android device. The trainer can then lookup previous player information from the database using 
the app to determine whether or not emergency medical staff need to be notified. 

If he determines that they are needed, a notification is sent to the emergency system 
to signal that they are needed.

To run the code: 
1: Clone the code from GitHub on all 4 devices:
	$ git clone https://github.com/nmc16/InjuryMonitoringSystem.git
	
2: Move into the run folder on all devices:
	$ cd InjuryMonitoringSytem/run
	
3: Run the setup file to create the dependencies: 
	$ ./setup.sh
	
4: Run the compiler:
	$ ./run.sh –c
	
   OR Point to the files directly using javac:
	$ javac -d ../target –cp ../dependencies/*:../src/*: ../src/**/*.java
	
5. Move into the target folder on all devices:
	$ cd ../target
	
6: Start the Database on one of the 4 devices where the variables are substituted with values: 
	$ ./run.sh –r controller.ControllerRunner THRESHOLD_VALUE HOST_PORT HOST_IP EMERGENCY_STATION_IP EMERGENCY_STATION_PORT
	OR
	$ java -cp dependencies/*:./*: controller.ContollerRunner THRESHOLD_VALUE HOST_PORT HOST_IP EMERGENCY_STATION_IP EMERGENCY_STATION_PORT
	
7. Start the EmergencySystem and enter the relevant information to connect to database and port:
	$ ./run.sh –r controller.EmergencySystem
	OR
	$ java -cp dependencies/*:./*: controller.EmergencySystem

8: Start the app:
	Hit connections button and input the IP address and port of the database 

9. Start the player and enter the relevant information to connect to database and port:
	$ ./run.sh –r controller.Player
	OR
	$ java -cp dependencies/*:./*: controller.Player
